    <!--Add a paragraph describing what you are going to review. This should be 2-3 sentences -->
    <p>Bauldurs Gate is a role playing game that loosely follows the rules of 
        Dungeons and Dragons. You can play with up to three other people, and interact 
        with  many non-player characters. Including a dog that you can adopt. Save the Owl Bear
        Cub. Trust me. 
    </p>
    <!--Add a H2 tag describing characters, game play, or some specific part of your review-->
    <h2>Character Types</h2>
    <!--Add a paragraph about whatever your H2 tag was-->
    <p>You can play as many different types of characters, warriors, theives, barabrian,
        palidin, or my favorite - a druid.

    <h3>Game Play</h3>
    <p>As no surprise, when playing with my kids who had been playing for years, I made a 
        few blunders. My kids have learned to save frequently, especially before battles. 
        This was really important when I decided to try the only animal form I hadn't used 
        yet mid battle with a bunch of goblins. It was a cat. I was imagining a big fighting
        cat, think thunder cats. That is not what I got.</p>
        <p>
        Me: <q>I&#39;m going to try my last form, the cat!</q><br>
        kids:<q><em>No! don't!!!</em></q>
    </p>
    <p>
        I became a fluffy house cat. With two hit points. 
    </p>
       <strong> We all died. </strong>
